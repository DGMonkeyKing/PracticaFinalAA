Machine learning project: Breast Cancer Detection
I'll use some machine learning techniques to compare which one is the best on this classification problem. My idea is to merge this project
with the prognostic and diagnostic od Breast Cancer.

# Steps I followed
Due to its a classification problem we going to start with a logistic regression to know
if a training example is benign(2) or malign(4). We will translate this values to 0 and 1
(to make it easier)

Then, I continue with a neural network. I going to play with the number of layers and with the weigths.
